## Running Locally

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
# OR
source env/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Open your browser to:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`

## Production Deployment

To host the app on a server like Azure:

1. Run `npm run build` inside the `frontend/` folder.
2. Place the resulting `build/` folder contents in your Django `static/` or `templates/` directory.
3. Run:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

4. Update your Django view to serve `index.html`:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html')
```

5. Optionally configure a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx) for production performance.
